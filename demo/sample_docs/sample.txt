This is a sample English document for testing the document parser.

It contains multiple paragraphs. The parser should detect structure and choose an appropriate chunking strategy.

Section two: retrieval benchmarks. You can query for "retrieval" or "chunking" to test semantic search.

Section three: RAG integration. The system stores chunks in a vector database and SQL for structured queries.
